# Curbside

Available daily from 8am-7pm. When shopping online make sure you are in the curbside menu area. Once your order is placed, we will enter you in our text based queue system. You’ll receive a text letting you know it’s time to drive in and pick up your order. Click the link in the text, then click “I’m coming”. After that, head on over.
