# Curbside

Curbside pick up is available daily from 8am-8pm. You can pre order as early as 7am, and ordering stops for curbside at 7pm.  When shopping online make sure you are in the curbside menu area.  Once your order is placed, we will enter you in our text based queue system. You’ll receive a text letting you know it’s time to drive in and pick up your order. Click the link in the text, then click “I’m coming”. After that, head on over.
