# Curbside

Curbside pick-up is available daily from 8am-8pm. You can pre order as early as 7am, and ordering stops for curbside at 7pm.  When shopping online make sure you are in the curbside menu area.  Once your order is placed, you will be notified that your order is being processed, and when the order is ready for pick up. Youâ€™ll receive a text with the amount of your order and to remind you to have your ID ready, and everyone has to be 21+ in the car.  NO EXCEPTIONS! After that, head on over.
