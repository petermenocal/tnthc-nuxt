## Curbside Ordering

When shopping online make sure you are in the curbside menu area. Once your order is placed, we will enter you in our text based queue system. You’ll receive a text letting you know it’s time to drive in and pick up your order. Click the link in the text, then click “I’m coming”. After that, head on over. Please do do show up to the store until you have received the text telling you to come down.

## Curbside Arrival

Please do not arrive until you have received a text prompting you to come in. You will not be allowed to come into the parking lot without a confirmation text. In order to not block traffic on Stephanie St, turn up Construction Ave and circle the block to come down Emerald Ave. Someone from Top Notch will be there to greet you. We will have cars Queue on Emerald until we clear you to come into the parking lot.
