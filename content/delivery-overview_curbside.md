## Curbside Ordering

When shopping online make sure you are in the curbside menu area. Once your order is placed you will receive a text stating your order is being processed. Once your order is ready a text will be sent out with your total, and a message saying it's time to pick up your order.  Please do not show up to the store until you have received the text telling you to come down. 

*Curbside preorders open at 7am.*

## Curbside Arrival

Please do not arrive until you have received a text prompting you to come in.  Once your order is placed, you will be notified that your order is being processed, and when the order is ready for pick up.  Youâ€™ll receive a text with the amount of your order and to remind you to have your ID ready, and everyone has to be 21+ and no children in the car.  NO EXCEPTIONS!  After that, head on over.
