title: Delivery -> Overview - Numbered
slot1: Shop online and browse our wide variety of products. All orders must have a valid State or Federal picture ID uploaded with it. For Medical Patients it must be a valid Medical Marijuana Card. For others a State or Federal picture id can be used. The person receiving the order must match the picture on the ID submitted with the order.
slot2: When a delivery order is placed a team member will be in contact with you through the WeedMaps text system to verify your order before sending it to processing. Once verified with all the delivery details the order will be sent to fulfillment for packaging and checkout.
slot3: When the order is ready to be delivered, we will send out a text with the amount of the order. When the driver is ready to leave the store you will receive another text letting you know they will be leaving on their route. Please have as close to the actual amount as you can. We only accept cash payments.
slot4: When the driver arrives, please try to maintain the required distance from them. They will hand you your order, collect payment, then have you sign the drivers app, and the required Nevada State Delivery Manifest. Note - Drivers do not carry change.
